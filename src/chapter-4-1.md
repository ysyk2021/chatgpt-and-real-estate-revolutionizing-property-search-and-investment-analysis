Introduction to AI and Chatbots
======================================================================================

Introduction
------------

Artificial intelligence (AI) and chatbots are becoming increasingly important in the real estate industry. They have the potential to improve property search and investment analysis by providing personalized recommendations and insights based on user preferences. In this chapter, we will provide an introduction to AI and chatbots and their role in the real estate industry.

What is AI?
-----------

AI refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and natural language processing. AI can be divided into two categories: narrow or weak AI, which is designed to perform specific tasks, and general or strong AI, which can perform any intellectual task that a human can.

What are Chatbots?
------------------

Chatbots are computer programs that simulate human conversation through text or voice interactions. They can assist users in a variety of tasks, such as answering questions, providing information, and completing transactions. Chatbots can be divided into two categories: rule-based chatbots, which follow pre-programmed rules, and AI-powered chatbots, which use machine learning algorithms to improve their responses over time.

Conclusion
----------

AI and chatbots have the potential to revolutionize the real estate industry by improving property search and investment analysis processes. By leveraging their capabilities, organizations can provide better services to their clients and make informed decisions. As technology continues to advance, we can expect to see more organizations implementing AI and chatbots in the real estate industry and creating positive impacts in the field.
